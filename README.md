## 🔍 Problem Statement

As a motorsport enthusiast, I wanted to **track and analyze** my performance during simulated racing sessions. Commercial tools often lack customization or are limited to specific games or hardware. I needed a **self-hosted solution** that could:
- Record telemetry data from my races
- Store and process the data securely
- Train and serve a machine learning model to give feedback based on elite e-sports drivers
- Run efficiently and scalably via **Dockerized deployment on Azure**

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Create a full-featured telemetry **web app server** for racing simulation data
- Train a **machine learning model** to detect driving inefficiencies and recommend improvements
- Compare personal performance with data from **Formula 1, Le Mans Hypercar, GT3, and Rally e-sports drivers**
- Deploy the system using **Docker** on **Microsoft Azure** for real-world performance testing
- Improve expertise in ML pipelines, server architecture, and cloud-native deployment
